// Importing the UIKit means that this file will reference the iOS user interface toolkit
import UIKit

// This means that I want to create a new screen called ViewController that extends UITableViewController
class ViewController: UITableViewController {

    // Here we have a variable called pictures in the LHS
    // In the RHS, we want to make it into a String Array using [String] and then we use () to tell Swift that we want to make it now
    // Thus, this one line of code will create a String array called pictures and will exist from when the ViewController screen is created until when it is destroyed. Note that it behaves this way because pictures is a property of ViewController and exists within the class rather than within a method.
    var pictures = [String]()
    
    // We override the function because we want to change Apple's default behavior from within the UIViewController class
    // viewDidLoad is called when the screen is loaded and is ready for us to optimize
    // All properties for viewDidLoad() are created when viewDidLoad is created and are destroyed when viewDidLoad is finished being called
    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
        
        title = "Storm Viewer"
        
        // Do any additional setup after loading the view, typically from a nib.
        
        // We have a constant fm that is assigned a value returned by FileManager.default. FileManager is a data type that lets us work with the file system. We'll be using it to help us look for files
        let fm = FileManager.default
        
        // Sets the resource path of the bundle to a constant named path. It basically says "tell me where all the iamges I added to my app can be found
        // Notice the 'Bundle.main.resourcePath!'. It includes an exclamation point at the end because it may or may not return a String, but I'm certain that it will. --- Remember there are 3 ways Swift stores data. 1. The normal way I'm used to 2. Using optionals '?' if it might or might not return a value 3. Using '!' for when it might or might not return a value, but I'm certain that it will.
        let path = Bundle.main.resourcePath!
        
        // The items constant is an array/collection of all the names of the files that are found in the resource directory of our app. Using the path value being passed in, this line is essentially getting the contents of the specific directory, which we have said to be resources
        // The 'try!' keyword means that the following code has a potential to go wrong, but I'm absolutely sure that it won't
        let items = try! fm.contentsOfDirectory(atPath: path)
        
        // I'm going to eventually realize that there are many times where a variable doesn't change and I'll end up using constants (through the keyword 'let') more often.
        
        // Go through the items array which we got from calling contentsOfDirectory()
        for item in items {
            // For each item in the items array, we check to see if it contains nssl using hasPrefix()
            if item.hasPrefix("nssl") {
                // We'll add each item with the prefix "nssl" to our pictures array
                pictures.append(item)
            }
