This is my first project using Swift. I also came back a couple days later to add additional functionality to the project.

This project includes:
  1. Familiarizing myself with Swift foundamentals and xcode
  2. Using the View Controller
  3. Working inside Main.storyboard
  4. Working with the following methods inside ViewController:
    a. viewDidLoad() - Method to get the path for the images from FileManager and store them for me to optimize
    b. tableView() - Method to optimize the functionality of the table view that displays pictures
  5. Working with the following methods inside DetailViewController:
    a. viewDidLoad() - Used this method to check and unwrap the image selected in the preview screen
    b. viewWillAppear() - Method called when view is about to be shown
    c. viewWillDisappear() - Method called when view is about to be destroyed
    d. shareTapped() - Method that let's us share via airdrop, social media, etc.
  6. Many comments
